## Introduction

`component-cli` is a _package manager_ for WebAssembly Components and WebAssembly
Interface Types (WIT). It can search, fetch, and publish WebAssembly to registries
like GitHub Packages and Docker Hub. It also automatically resolves dependencies, tracks releases, and generates lockfiles to ensure deterministic builds.

`component-cli` is intended to be used together with language-specific wasm
toolchains. The idea is that you can use a language-specific compiler to compile
source code to `.wasm` binaries. And then use `component-cli` to handle everything
else, including: executing, publishing, linking, and debugging.

`component-cli` can either be used directly from the command line, or embedded into
other applications via the `component-package-manager` Rust crate. This makes it
possible for other Wasm tools to search and install Wasm Components without ever
leaving the application. Coupled with the "search-by-interface" functionality, this makes it possible to filter the search down only compatible components.

> [!CAUTION]
> This repository is under active development and therefore unstable. Breaking
> changes are expected. Contributions and ideas however are still welcome!

## Quick start

```bash
$ component init                              # Create a `wasm.toml` and `wasm.lock.toml` locally
$ component install ba:sample-wasi-http-rust  # Install a `wasi:http` server as a dependency
$ component run ba:sample-wasi-http-rust      # Run the `wasi:http` server
$ curl localhost:8080                    # Send a request to the `wasi:http` server
```

## Installation

### Bash (Linux / macOS)

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/component-cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

### PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
irm https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/component-cli/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Cargo (Rust)

```sh
cargo install component
```

## Local development

To stand up the full stack (frontend, backend, and Postgres) locally using Docker:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

| Service  | URL                       | Description                        |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Frontend | http://localhost:8080     | WASM component served by wasmtime  |
| Backend  | http://localhost:8081     | Meta-registry API (SQLite-backed)  |
| Postgres | localhost:5432            | Ready for the SQLite→Postgres migration |

To add a new registry namespace, add a `.toml` file to `registry/` then rebuild:

```sh
docker compose build backend
docker compose up -d backend
```

## Safety
This crate uses ``#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`` to ensure everything is implemented in
100% Safe Rust.

## Notes on AI
This project is developed with GitHub Copilot. We believe language models can be 
valuable tools for coding when paired with human oversight, testing, and 
careful review. For transparency, we mention this in the README.
